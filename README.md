- I have faced an issue where the 'Create and share post' section disappeared from browser after deploying the app. I investigated this issue and I found the element is still exist, but there is a new CSS selector called 'injection style' was added, I didn't create. After researching this issue, I found the browser generates the 'injection style' when the users use adblockers extension, to handle this issue I found many ways, but I have tried to test my approach to change the name of the parent class and delete the 'share' word and everything began work correctly.
